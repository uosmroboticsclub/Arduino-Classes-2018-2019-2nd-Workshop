# Introduction :laughing:
Hey guys Hank here! Welcome to UoSM Robotics Club's Second Workshop! If you have any questions please ask!

# There are 2 main folders here, MotorTest and PowerPoint!
1. Folder MotorTest contains code for testing the robot chasis. Please go through the powerpoint before running the code.
2. The Folder PowerPoint contains the step-to-step instructions for building the robot chasis from scratch.
3. The two mp4 videos are a reference on how to build the robot, but you might have insufficient screws, so just use duct tape to paste the battery holder, maker uno and motor driver on the chasis. 

# Getting Started
1. Download the zip code of this file, then extract it.
1. Alternatively you can fork this project and open in Visual Studios and use the Team Explorer in Visual Studios to help you clone the entire project. Not recommended for beginners. Please consult help if unsure.
2. Go through the powerpoint and finally upload the code to the maker uno (also included in powerpoint).
2. If the online video does not work, use the videos in the main folder instead.
3. Have fun!

# Contribute
1. How do we control the robot to move in a certain direction for a desired period?
2. How do I make my robot move in a straight line? (No PID tuning is required)
3. How do I make my robot curve instead of spinning on its central axis?

#If you want to explore more
Our workshop is referenced from Cytron Technologies powerpoint and code
